# MindBridge â€” Brain-Driven, Emotion-Adaptive ChatGPT Interface

**Tagline:** MindBridge integrates cognitive intent decoding, affective adaptation, and brain-control to enable hands-free, emotionally-aware ChatGPT conversations.

## Overview
MindBridge is a hackathon prototype demonstrating how EEG signals can:
1. Generate text intents (Cognitive-to-Linguistic),
2. Adapt ChatGPT tone based on emotion (Emotionally Adaptive),
3. Provide brain-driven interface commands (Brain-Controlled).

This repository contains training code, inference pipeline, and a Streamlit demo integrating the three pipelines.
